# LeetAI

LeetAI is a project that aims to enhance my Leetcode solutions by combining them with AI-generated problem descriptions and explanations. With this project, I can save my Leetcode solutions along with detailed problem descriptions and explanations, all automatically generated using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 API.

## How it Works

LeetAI consists of several components working together:

1. **GPT-3.5 API**: OpenAI's GPT-3.5 API is used to generate problem descriptions and solution explanations. Given a problem's title, description, and my solution, GPT-3.5 generates a detailed explanation, providing a deep understanding of the problem and solution.

2. **GitHub Integration**: LeetAI seamlessly integrates with GitHub, allowing you to save my Leetcode solutions and their corresponding problem descriptions and explanations directly to my GitHub repository. This ensures that my solutions are well-documented and organized.

## Contributions and Support
