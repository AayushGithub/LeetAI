# Explanation

This solution checks if a given number `n` is an ugly number. An ugly number is a positive number whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.

The solution starts by checking if `n` is less than or equal to 0. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, it means that it is not a positive number, and thus cannot be an ugly number. In this case, the function returns False.

Next, the solution enters a loop where it repeatedly divides `n` by 2, 3, and 5 as long as `n` is divisible by these numbers. This is done using the modulo operator `%` to check if `n` is divisible by a number and the floor division operator `//` to perform the division. 

By dividing `n` by 2, 3, and 5, any prime factors other than these numbers get eliminated. For example, if `n` is divisible by 2, it means that it has 2 as a factor, so we divide `n` by 2 to remove this factor and repeat the process until `n` is no longer divisible by 2. The same is done for 3 and 5. 

Finally, after eliminating all prime factors other than 2, 3, and 5, the solution checks if `n` is equal to 1. If `n` is equal to 1, it means that all other prime factors have been divided out and we are left with only 2, 3, and 5 as prime factors. In this case, the function returns True, indicating that `n` is an ugly number. Otherwise, if `n` is not equal to 1, it means that `n` has prime factors other than 2, 3, and 5, and thus cannot be an ugly number. In this case, the function returns False.

This solution works correctly because it checks all the conditions required for a number to be an ugly number. It handles edge cases where `n` is less than or equal to 0, and it eliminates all prime factors other than 2, 3, and 5.
