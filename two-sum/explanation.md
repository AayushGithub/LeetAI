**Explanation:**

This solution uses a hash table to store the elements of the array `nums` as keys and their indices as values. 

The function starts by initializing an empty dictionary called `checkList`. Then, it iterates through each element of the array `nums` using a for loop.

For each element `nums[i]`, it checks if the difference between the target number `target` and `nums[i]` exists in the `checkList` dictionary. If the difference exists in the dictionary, it means that we have found the two elements that add up to the target. In this case, the function returns a list containing the indices of the two elements: `[checkList[target-nums[i]], i]`.

If the difference does not exist in the `checkList` dictionary, the function adds `nums[i]` as a key and its index `i` as the corresponding value to the `checkList` dictionary. This allows us to later check if any subsequent elements can be used to complete the target sum.

If the function completes the loop without finding a pair of elements that sum up to the target, it returns an empty list `[]`.

**Correctness:**

The solution is correct because it guarantees to find a pair of elements that add up to the target, if such a pair exists.

The checkList dictionary allows us to store the indices of elements we have encountered so far, along with their corresponding values. By storing the elements as keys, we can easily check if the difference between the target and the current element exists in the dictionary.

Since we are iterating through all the elements of the array `nums` exactly once, the time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array.
